# Crop-Water-Requirement-ML-Project-
I developed a Crop Water Requirement model that calculates the water requirement for a specific crop based on factors such as crop type, soil type, region (desert, dry, wetland), and weather conditions and based on minimum and maximum temperature. By Applying a machine larning model, I used a Random Forest model and implemented it using pipeline functions in Python. After training the model, I evaluated its accuracy and found it to be excellent. I then saved the model using the Pickle library and deployed it as a web application using the Streamlit library, which provides a web-based interface."
